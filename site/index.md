**Zazen** (座禅) brings philosophy-driven coding standards to your development workflow:
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Write code that tells a clear story
- **Readability first** - Optimize for human understanding
- **Single responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose
- **Explicit over implicit** - Make intentions obvious

## Quick Start

### One-Line Installation

Install Zazen directly from GitHub:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daviguides/zazen/main/install.sh)"
```

## What is Zazen?

Zazen (座禅 - seated meditation) is a collection of **language-agnostic** and **language-specific** coding guidelines designed as a **Claude Code plugin**. Like seated meditation, Zazen helps you write code with mindfulness - clear structure, proper naming, and zen-like simplicity.

### Universal Principles

The foundation of Zazen applies to any programming language:

- **Write code in English** - Facilitate international collaboration
- **Prioritize clarity and readability** - Code is read more than written
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each function/class does one thing well
- **Avoid magic numbers/strings** - Use named constants
- **Errors should never pass silently** - Make failures obvious

### Language Support

- **Python** - Complete guidelines including Zen of Python
- **TDD** - Test-driven development principles

## Philosophy

Zazen is built on timeless software engineering principles, adapted for modern development workflows and AI-assisted coding. Whether you're writing Python, Rust, Go, or any other language, these principles help you create code that is:

- **Beautiful** - Well-structured and aesthetically pleasing
- **Explicit** - Clear about intentions and behavior
- **Simple** - Uses the simplest solution that works
- **Flat** - Avoids unnecessary nesting
- **Readable** - Optimized for human understanding
