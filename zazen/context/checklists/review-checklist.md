# Code Review Checklist

## Post-Implementation Verification

### ✅ Group 1: Foundations (CRITICAL)

**Beautiful (PEP 8):**
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 (indentation, spacing, line length ≤80)
- [ ] Names are consistent with project patterns
- [ ] Structure is clean and organized

**Explicit (Clear Intentions):**
- [ ] All code intentions are clear
- [ ] No "magic" or implicit behaviors
- [ ] Can be understood without special knowledge

**Readability (Human-First):**
- [ ] A junior developer could understand this code
- [ ] Code tells a clear story
- [ ] Avoided unnecessary cleverness

### ✅ Group 2: Structure (CRITICAL)

**Simple vs Complex:**
- [ ] Used the simplest solution for this problem
- [ ] If complex, problem is inherently complex
- [ ] Avoided over-engineering

**Flat (No Deep Nesting):**
- [ ] No unnecessary nesting levels
- [ ] Used guard clauses or early returns where appropriate
- [ ] Control flow is linear and clear

**Sparse (Proper Spacing):**
- [ ] Code has adequate spacing
- [ ] No dense or compressed lines
- [ ] Complex expressions broken into multiple lines

### ✅ Group 3: Decisions (WHEN APPLICABLE)

**Special Cases:**
- [ ] Maintained consistency even in edge cases
- [ ] No unique solutions for "special" cases
- [ ] Followed established patterns

**Practicality vs Purity:**
- [ ] If broke convention, clear practical benefit exists
- [ ] Documented reason for exception
- [ ] Benefit justifies the deviation

**Ambiguity:**
- [ ] No assumptions about inputs or behavior
- [ ] Forced clarity where ambiguity existed
- [ ] Documented necessary assumptions

**One Obvious Way:**
- [ ] Used Pythonic approach
- [ ] Followed established language conventions
- [ ] Did not reinvent the wheel

### ✅ Group 4: Implementation Details

**Type Hints:**
- [ ] All function parameters have type hints
- [ ] All return types are annotated
- [ ] Used Python 3.13+ syntax (`list[str]` not `List[str]`)
- [ ] Union types use `|` not `Union`

**Function Structure:**
- [ ] Functions have single responsibility
- [ ] Function names are descriptive
- [ ] Parameters use keyword arguments when multiple
- [ ] Input validation at function start
- [ ] No hidden side effects

**Class Structure:**
- [ ] Single clear responsibility
- [ ] Public interface is intuitive
- [ ] Constructor validates initial state
- [ ] Private methods are clear helpers

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] No bare `except:` clauses
- [ ] Specific exception types used
- [ ] Error messages include context
- [ ] Exception chaining with `from e`
- [ ] Errors never pass silently (unless explicitly intended)

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Module docstring exists
- [ ] Class docstrings exist
- [ ] Public function docstrings exist
- [ ] Docstrings are ≤80 columns
- [ ] Args, Returns, Raises documented where applicable

**Imports:**
- [ ] Organized in 3 groups (stdlib, third-party, local)
- [ ] Blank lines between groups
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] Used pathlib over os.path

**Style:**
- [ ] Used f-strings (not % or .format())
- [ ] No magic numbers (named constants used)
- [ ] Trailing commas in multi-line constructs
- [ ] Lines ≤80 characters

## Severity-Based Issues

### 🔴 High Severity (Fix Immediately)
- Silent error handling (bare except)
- Missing type hints
- Deep nesting (> 3 levels)
- Missing input validation
- Security issues
- Functions > 100 lines

### 🟡 Medium Severity (Fix Soon)
- PEP 8 violations
- Unclear naming
- Magic numbers
- Missing docstrings
- Old Python syntax
- Not using pathlib

### 🟢 Low Severity (Nice to Have)
- Missing trailing commas
- Import organization
- Minor style issues
- Docstring formatting

## Final Approval Checklist

**ALL items must be TRUE before approving:**

**Fundamentals:**
- ✅ Code follows PEP 8 automatically
- ✅ All intentions are explicit
- ✅ Readability prioritized over cleverness

**Structure:**
- ✅ Solution is simple for the problem
- ✅ Structure is flat (no unnecessary nesting)
- ✅ Code is well-spaced and not dense

**Pragmatism:**

**Organization:**
- ✅ Namespaces used effectively

**If ANY item is ❌ → Request changes before merging**
