# TDD Quality Checklist

## Pre-TDD Checklist

**Before starting test-driven development:**

- [ ] Requirements clearly understood
- [ ] Feature specification documented (for new features)
- [ ] Scenario matrix defined
- [ ] Test categories identified (unit, integration, property, etc.)

## Test Generation Checklist

**For each test generated:**

### Structure
- [ ] Follows AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- [ ] Has descriptive function name following convention
- [ ] Has clear docstring explaining what is tested
- [ ] Has type hints on all parameters
- [ ] Returns None (test functions)

### Content
- [ ] Arranges test data explicitly (no hidden setup)
- [ ] Acts on function/component under test
- [ ] Asserts expected behavior clearly
- [ ] Uses specific assertions (not just `assert result`)
- [ ] Includes assertion messages for complex checks

### Coverage
- [ ] Tests one logical concern
- [ ] Covers happy path scenario OR
- [ ] Covers edge case scenario OR
- [ ] Covers error scenario OR
- [ ] Covers performance requirement OR
- [ ] Validates property/invariant

## Test Suite Completeness Checklist

**For complete test suite:**

### Scenario Coverage
- [ ] All scenario matrix cells have tests
- [ ] Happy path scenarios tested (3-5 minimum)

### Test Categories
- [ ] Unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Integration tests for all component interactions

## Integration Checklist

**For integration tests:**

- [ ] All component interactions tested
- [ ] Database operations tested

- [ ] Transaction handling tested
- [ ] Error propagation tested
- [ ] Cache integration tested (if applicable)

## Property Test Checklist

**For property-based tests:**

- [ ] Invariants identified
- [ ] Appropriate strategies selected
- [ ] Sufficient examples generated (100+ default)
- [ ] Properties validate anti-hallucination
- [ ] Edge cases handled by hypothesis

## Error Handling Checklist

**For error tests:**

- [ ] All error scenarios identified
- [ ] Specific exception types tested
- [ ] Error messages validated
- [ ] Error context preserved (exception chaining)
- [ ] State remains consistent after error
- [ ] Resources cleaned up on error

## Performance Checklist

**For performance tests:**

- [ ] Performance requirements documented
- [ ] Baseline established
- [ ] Load tests implemented (if needed)
- [ ] Memory usage validated (if needed)
- [ ] Scaling characteristics validated
- [ ] Performance regression detection in place

## Documentation Checklist

**Documentation requirements:**

- [ ] Test files have module docstrings
- [ ] Complex test setups documented
- [ ] Test data factories documented
- [ ] Fixture purposes documented
- [ ] Special test configurations documented

## Maintenance Checklist

**For long-term maintenance:**

- [ ] Tests are not brittle
- [ ] Tests use minimal mocking
- [ ] Test data is clear and explicit
- [ ] Tests serve as documentation
- [ ] Tests are easy to understand
- [ ] Tests are easy to modify

## Final Validation Checklist

**Before considering TDD complete:**

- [ ] All pre-TDD checklist items completed
- [ ] All test generation checklist items completed
- [ ] All test suite completeness items validated
- [ ] All code coverage requirements met
- [ ] All post-implementation validation passed
- [ ] All category-specific checklists completed
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing

## Quick Reference

### Red Flags (Stop if Found)
- ❌ Tests written after implementation
