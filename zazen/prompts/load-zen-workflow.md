## Workflow Instructions

**Before generating code:**
1. Review pre-code checklist
2. Identify implementation context (function/class/module/error/refactor)
3. Consult decision matrix in zen-implementation-guide

**During code generation:**
1. Apply naming conventions
2. Use guard clauses (flat > nested)
3. Make all intentions explicit
4. Handle errors explicitly (never silent)

**After code generation:**
1. Self-verify against all Zen principles
2. Check for red flags
3. Ensure all validations pass

**Conflict Resolution:**
When principles conflict, follow hierarchy:
1. Readability ALWAYS wins
2. Explicit > Implicit
3. Simple > Complex
4. Practicality > Purity (with clear benefit)
5. Consistency > Cleverness

Apply these Zen principles to ALL code generated in this session.
